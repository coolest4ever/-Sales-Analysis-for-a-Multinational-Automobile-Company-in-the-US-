## Data Collection
Sales data was obtained from a central transaction database of the company representing orders placed by customers across multiple countries. Each record included attributes such as:

* `Customer ID`
* `OrderNo`
* `OrderQuantity`
* `CostPrice_usd`
* `SellingPrice_usd`
* `OrderDate`
* `CustomerName`
* `CustomerCity`
* `CustomerState`
* `CustomerCountry`
* `ProductCategory`
* `ProductColor`
* `Model`

## Data Pre-processing
**Data Loading**: 
Reading the Raw Dataset which originally existed as a CSV file into a Pandas Dataframe

```python
# solution

import pandas as pd

bikes_df = pd.read_csv("/Users/cynthiamatthew/Downloads/bikes.csv")


bikes_df.head()
```

## Data Inspection and Cleaning

- **1. Check for Missing values**:

```python
# solution 

bikes_df.isna().any()
```

<img width="253" height="234" alt="image 2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bd7e27ef-2a7c-43a1-a0b4-d49ef818233b" />


```python
# counting the number of missing values 

total_number_of_missing_values_by_column = bikes_df.isna().sum()

total_number_of_missing_values_by_column
```
<img width="316" height="219" alt="image 3" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb1935fd-859e-46f7-af8a-133e2b67d2f0" />

```python
# visualizing the total number of misssing values

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# using the bar plot to visualize the missing values


total_number_of_missing_values_by_column.plot(kind = "bar")

# to show the plot 
# call the plt.show()

plt.show()
```

- **2.Handling Missing values**:

```python
# solution

bikes_df["ProductColor"].mode()

bikes_df = bikes_df.fillna("Black")

bikes_df
```
<img width="1074" height="263" alt="image 13" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ce526fa-490f-404b-9dcd-b811009b999e" />


```python
# to verify that there are no more missing values on our dataset

bikes_df.isna().any()
```
<img width="303" height="231" alt="image 14" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/80472f7f-530b-4c4d-a182-b263ef6afffd" />


- **3. Check for  Duplicates**:

```python
# solution

# counting the total number of our datapoint 

len(bikes_df)
```

```python
# dropping any duplicates if any exists 

bikes_df.drop_duplicates(inplace = True)
```

- **4. Handling Duplicates**:
```python
# solution

# re-counting our data point again 

len(bikes_df)
# This shows that there was NO duplicates on our dataset
```

## Data Modification
```python
# generating some core metrics which were NOT provided from the dataset, which would be required for the purpose of the data analysis

# solution 

# (1) TotalCostPrice : To be obtained by (OrderQuantity x CostPrice_usd)


bikes_df["TotalCostPrice"] = bikes_df["OrderQuantity"] * bikes_df["CostPrice_usd"] 


# (2) SalesRevenue : To be obtained by (OrderQuantity x SellingPrice_usd)


bikes_df["SalesRevenue"] = bikes_df["OrderQuantity"] * bikes_df["SellingPrice_usd"] 


# (3) Profit : To be obtained by (SalesRevenue - TotalCostPrice)


bikes_df["Profit"] = bikes_df["SalesRevenue"]  - bikes_df["TotalCostPrice"]


# Displaying the result

bikes_df.head()
```

## Data Filtering
```python
# Filtering out the required datasat (a subset data) for the analysis

# Total Profits generated by States in the US

# logical condition 1

is_usa = bikes_df["CustomerCountry"] == "United States"

## Data Aggregation
```python
# Computing/ Aggregating the sales data to show the total profits by States
# solution 


total_profits_by_states_bikes_USA = bikes_data_usa.groupby(["CustomerState","CustomerCountry"])["Profit"].sum().reset_index()

## Comparizon of the Total Profits Generated by the Top-5 States in the US  to the Entire Total Profits made from the US (Bike products only)
```python
# Total Profits Generated by the Top-5 States 

total_profit_of_top_5_states = top_5_most_profotable_states["Profit"].sum()

total_profit_of_top_5_states
```

```python
# Entire Total Profits made from the US (Bike products only)

total_profit_of_the_entire_states = bikes_data_usa["Profit"].sum()

total_profit_of_the_entire_states
```
```python
# calculating the percentage 


percent = (total_profit_of_top_5_states / total_profit_of_the_entire_states) * 100

percent = percent .round(2)

## Data Interpretation

The Result from the data visualization above shows that **California**, **Washington**,  **Oregon**, **Florida** and **Wyoming** are the **top-5 states** generating the **highest profits** for **bike products** in the United States.

## Key Findings

---

* The analysis of bike product sales across the United States revealed that **California**, **Washington**, and **Oregon** are the top three states generating the highest profits by a significant margin.

* The top 5 most profitable states and their respective profit figures are as follows:

  | Rank | State      | Total Profit (\$) |
  | ---- | ---------- | ----------------- |
  | 1    | California | 2,247,278.04      |
  | 2    | Washington | 963,999.62        |
  | 3    | Oregon     | 457,411.67        |
  | 4    | Florida    | 3,206.34          |
  | 5    | Wyoming    | 2,868.76          |

* **California alone accounts for over \$2.2 million in profit**, contributes nearly half of the total profit from bike sales nationwide. Indicating a highly dominant market share.


* **Powerful Insight:** The combined total profit from these top 5 states accounts for **99.76% of the total profit** generated across all U.S. states for the bike product category.


* This reveals a **significant concentration of profitability**, with the remaining states contributing less than 0.24% of total profit.

* There is a **sharp drop in profit margins** between Oregon (3rd) and Florida (4th), suggesting a disparity in market performance between the top three states and the rest.

---

## Conclusions
---

* The U.S. market for the bike product is **heavily skewed**, with profitability overwhelmingly concentrated in just only five states accounting for **99.76% of the total profit** generated across all U.S. states for the bike product category.

  
* The remaining states exhibit **minimal or negligible sales impact**, indicating either very low market demand, lack of awareness, or distribution inefficiencies.


* The business is currently **over-reliant on a small subset of regions**, making it vulnerable to regional economic fluctuations or policy changes affecting those states.


* The profitability of bike products is **highly concentrated in the West Coast**, particularly in California, Washington, and Oregon.


* States like Florida and Wyoming, while making the top 5 list, generate **significantly lower profits**, indicating limited market penetration or demand.


* External factors such as **population density, cycling infrastructure, lifestyle preferences, and climate** may be influencing regional demand.

## Recommendation
---

1. **Double Down and Strengthen Sales & Distribution in the Top 5 States**
   Allocate more resources (inventory, marketing budget, local partnerships) and Increase investment in California, Washington, and Oregon—such as to to maintain momentum ,  expand market dominance and defend market share.


2. **Investigate and Conduct Diagnostic Analysis on Low-Performing States**
   Investigate why the remaining  U.S. states contribute less than 1% of total profit. Is it due to poor distribution? Lack of infrastructure? Low demand? Use this to inform turnaround strategies.

3. **Explore Market Diversification**
   To reduce regional dependency, test and pilot tailored campaigns in new promising states with favorable cycling culture, infrastructure, or climate (e.g., Colorado, Arizona, North Carolina).


4. **Scenario Planning & Risk Management**
   Build contingency plans around the top-performing states—since any disruption in these areas could dramatically impact total profitability.

5. **Refine Product Strategy by Region**
   Consider regional customization of product offerings, pricing, or marketing based on the stark difference in performance across states.

6. **Optimize Marketing Strategy**
   Use insights from high-profit regions to craft region-specific campaigns—emphasizing outdoor lifestyle, health, and environmental benefits of biking.

7. **Monitor Trends Over Time**
   Continue to track sales and profitability metrics to identify shifting trends, seasonal patterns, and emerging markets across the country.
