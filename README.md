# -Sales-Analysis-for-a-Multinational-Automobile-Company-in-the-US-
This data science research project  Analyses and presents the sales performance of a Multinational Automobile Company  Based in the United States.  

## Project Overview

This data science research project  Analyses and presents the sales performance of a Multinational Automobile Company  Based in the United States. 

The company’s sales transaction data generated over the past years was used for this  analysis.


The objective of the study is to analyze and identify the **Top 5 Most-Profitable States for the Bike Product Category in the United States**, offering critical business insights into regional sales dynamics, and strategic growth opportunities.


Leveraging advanced data analytics techniques, including data preprocessing, aggregation, and visualization, this project uncovers key patterns in regional sales dynamics across diverse markets. 


By ranking the States based on total profit generated, the analysis empowers business stakeholders with actionable intelligence to optimize regional sales management, tailor marketing strategies, and enhance profitability in a globally competitive landscape.

This project serves as a practical application of data science principles in the domain of e-commerce, showcasing the impact of data-driven decision-making on strategic business outcomes.

### Problem Statement  
**What are the Top-5 Most-Profitable States for the Bike Product Category in the United States ?**

### Project Objectives 
1. **To To collect, clean, and preprocess sales data from the multinational automobile company, ensuring data quality and consistency for accurate analysis
.**

2. **To filter and isolate sales records related specifically to the ‘Bike’ product category across all U.S. states for focused profitability analysis.**

3. **To calculate the total revenue and profit generated from bike sales per state, incorporating relevant metrics such as revenue, and profit.**

4. **To identify and rank the top 5 U.S. states based on total profit generated from bike sales within the specified timeframe.**

5. **To visualize sales performance by state using data visualization tools such as bar charts for clear and intuitive insights.**

6. **To derive actionable insights and recommendations for the company's sales and marketing teams on how to optimize their strategy in high-performing states.**

7. ### Data Source
8. **The Company's central transaction database**

9. ### Project Methodology

10. - **Data Collection**: Data was collected from the Company's Central Transaction Database

- **Data Pre-processing**: Loaded the data from a CSV file into a Pandas Dataframe

- **Data Inspection and Cleaning**: Checked for Missing values, Checked for Duplicates.

- - Handled missing values
  - Handled duplicate values

- **Data Modification**: generated some  core metrics which were NOT provided from the dataset, and would be required for the purpose of the data   analysis

- **Data Filtering**: To Filter out the required dataset(a subset data) for the analysis: Transactions on Bikes Products which occurred only in the United States**


- **Data Aggregation**: To Compute the major metric : **Total Profits generated by States in the US**

- **Data Sorting/ Data Ranking**: To Determine the Most Importat Metric:  **Top-5 Most-Profitable States for the Bike Product Category in the United States**

- **Data Visualization**: To uncover the **Top-5 Most-Profitable States for the Bike Product Category in the United States** in a pictorial form.

- **Data Interpretation**:

- **Key Findings**

- **Conclusions**

- **Reconmendation**

### Data Collection
Sales data was obtained from a central transaction database of the company representing orders placed by customers across multiple countries. Each record included attributes such as:

* `Customer ID`
* `OrderNo`
* `OrderQuantity`
* `CostPrice_usd`
* `SellingPrice_usd`
* `OrderDate`
* `CustomerName`
* `CustomerCity`
* `CustomerState`
* `CustomerCountry`
* `ProductCategory`
* `ProductColor`
* `Model`

### Data Pre-processing
**Data Loading**: 
Reading the Raw Dataset which originally existed as a CSV file into a Pandas Dataframe

```python
# solution

import pandas as pd

bikes_df = pd.read_csv("/Users/cynthiamatthew/Downloads/bikes.csv")


bikes_df.head()
```


### Data Inspection and Cleaning

- **1. Check for Missing values**:

```python
# solution 

bikes_df.isna().any()
```



```python
# counting the number of missing values 

total_number_of_missing_values_by_column = bikes_df.isna().sum()

total_number_of_missing_values_by_column
```

```python
# visualizing the total number of misssing values

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# using the bar plot to visualize the missing values


total_number_of_missing_values_by_column.plot(kind = "bar")

# to show the plot 
# call the plt.show()

plt.show()
```

- **2.Handling Missing values**:

```python
# solution

bikes_df["ProductColor"].mode()

bikes_df = bikes_df.fillna("Black")

bikes_df
```
```python
# to verify that there are no more missing values on our dataset

bikes_df.isna().any()
```

- **3. Check for  Duplicates**:

```python
# solution

# counting the total number of our datapoint 

len(bikes_df)
```
```python
# dropping any duplicates if any exists 

bikes_df.drop_duplicates(inplace = True)
```

- **4. Handling Duplicates**:
```python
# solution

# re-counting our data point again 

len(bikes_df)
# This shows that there was NO duplicates on our dataset
```

### Data Modification
# generating some core metrics which were NOT provided from the dataset, which would be required for the purpose of the data analysis

# solution 

# (1) TotalCostPrice : To be obtained by (OrderQuantity x CostPrice_usd)


bikes_df["TotalCostPrice"] = bikes_df["OrderQuantity"] * bikes_df["CostPrice_usd"] 


# (2) SalesRevenue : To be obtained by (OrderQuantity x SellingPrice_usd)


bikes_df["SalesRevenue"] = bikes_df["OrderQuantity"] * bikes_df["SellingPrice_usd"] 


# (3) Profit : To be obtained by (SalesRevenue - TotalCostPrice)


bikes_df["Profit"] = bikes_df["SalesRevenue"]  - bikes_df["TotalCostPrice"]


# Displaying the result

bikes_df.head()
